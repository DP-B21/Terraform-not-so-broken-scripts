The playbooks in this directory are used to test each class of node on Somerville to verify that the network routes are online and that the machines can reach others on each subnet they should be active on. This directory can be checked out on the admin node and the playbooks executed from there, as the local ansible setup already includes all the Somerville hosts in their appropriate groupings.

The playbooks will first print out the 'ip routes show' for each machine in the system class, as defined by /etc/ansible/hosts on the admin node. They will then try to ping a single node on each network subnet, verifying that the routing is working. If any of the tests fail then there is likely an issue with the network connection on the machine reporting the failure, or with the routing between that machine and the target (which may reside in another rack).
